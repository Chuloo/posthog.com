The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is to use [PostHog Cloud](/pricing).

However, if you're a large company with the need to self-host or an engineer looking to use the open-source version in funky non-production way then you're in the right place!

## PostHog Open-Source

The core of PostHog is open-source and always will be. You can self-host PostHog the open-source version in weird and wonderful ways such as running it in your basement to [monitor a home IoT system](https://gist.github.com/mariusandra/d8add5fc7f32bedeae45d9ce8eb75b35).

Self-hosted open-source deployment is **not** recommended in production and is unlikely to handle >100k events/month. There's significant complexity around deployment and maintenance with a high risk of data loss. As a small team we can only provide limited [support](/docs/self-host/open-source/support).

It is not possible to upgrade from PostHog open-source to PostHog Scale (the feature complete version of PostHog).

For more information on deployment go to [open-source deployment](/docs/self-host/open-source/deployment).

## PostHog Enterprise

Built for large companies with significant data isolation requirements. Requires a minimum contract of $5,000/month.

Deployment options:
- Deploy PostHog using Kubernetes on your own cloud
    - This requires knowledge of Kubernetes and your engineering team's time for deployment and ongoing maintenance. We are happy to provide reasonable [support](/docs/self-host/enterprise/support).
    - [Enterprise deployment](/docs/self-host/enterprise/overview) contains the information you need to get set up - we recommend you get a license key first.
    - To get the license key [book a call](/book-a-demo) with our customer success team.
- Work with a PostHog partner
    - Several of our [partners](/partners) might be an option for more involved support. We can direct you on the call to who is best suited.
- PostHog Cloud Enterprise
    - For most customers, the Enterprise version of [PostHog Cloud](/pricing) will satisfy their compliance and privacy needs.
